            <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p>Mars is designed with large communities in mind. When you are the game master for a mission, you take on a big responsibility to deliver a fun experience to the players. Current implementations for real-time control don't offer enough detail and cause a lot of headaches when trying to do specific things. The goal of Mars is to create a platform that is extensible and robust, allowing communities to create their own additions and customise it to suit their needs<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEPNvdn-As4" class="nolink">.</a></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="panel-cbox-wide slideUp">
            <h1>Extensibility</h1>
            <p>Mars follows the same development environment and coding guidelines as <a href="http://ace3mod.com">ACE3</a> - for a strong foundation, and familiar design. With it you can easily adapt the editor to your community's modset and playstyle. All it takes is a few config files and functions, and in a short amount of time you'll be able to improve the quality of a mission, and with it the players' experience.</p>
