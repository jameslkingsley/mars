<meta name="description" content="First community test
Mars was kindly tested in a couple of communities recently; ARCOMM and DDCA3. While still very buggy and not feature-complete, the feedback was mostly positive. There are some significant issues with FPS at the moment, where your game would freeze when highlighting units, but other than that it is currently a usable infantry controller.

<p>Mars was kindly tested in a couple of communities recently; <a href="http://www.arcomm.co/">ARCOMM</a> and <a href="https://ddca3.com/">DDCA3</a>. While still very buggy and not feature-complete, the feedback was mostly positive. There are some significant issues with FPS at the moment, where your game would freeze when highlighting units, but other than that it is currently a usable infantry controller.</p>

<p>Moving forward I definitely want more groups to try it out; the usability feedback is incredibly useful. The development process is ongoing so there will never be a final version - there are endless possibilities for what you can add to it (within the constraints of Arma). One thing I’m particularly excited about implementing is an <code class="highlighter-rouge">attachTo</code> system for when you need biplane dog fights with M2’s. It’s the little things in life, right?</p>

<p>Below you’ll find some screenshots I took while using it with around 15 players and 2 headless clients. The AI were very responsive and setting up a mission on-the-go took less than 5 minutes. The players on the ground said the AI felt more aggressive than usual - certainly a step up from Zeus.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h2>
<p>By the end of 2016 I’m hoping to have the FPS issues resolved and a much more stable build for groups to try out. There are still lots of AI commands to add, particularly for vehicles but now that the underlying framework is solid those <em>shouldn’t</em> take long to implement.</p>

<p>If you have an idea for Mars then feel free to post it on the <a href="https://github.com/marseditor/mars/issues/32">feature requests</a>. It’s nice to be able to see the progress of the baseline features and what people are interested in most.</p>

<p>If you’re not on Mars’ Discord server then I urge you to <a href="https://discord.gg/0vfzEmmrAOu1T2uk">join</a>! There’s also a <a href="https://twitter.com/marsmod">Twitter</a> account for Mars now so I also urge you to follow that for sporadic updates and terrible attempts at humour.</p>
