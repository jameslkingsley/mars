<div class="qa">
    <h1>What is Mars?</h1>
    <h2>Mars is a total Zeus replacement providing Arma communities with a customisable editor capable of realtime mission creation and enhancement.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>How is Mars different from Zeus?</h1>
    <h2>
        - Spawning directly on server or any of the connected headless clients<br />
        - Proper interface (like Eden) without clunky module framework<br />
        - Far more in-depth AI control via context menus<br />
        - Proper 3rd party mod support - entire framework for any kind of UI or function element you can imagine<br />
        - More entities visible (those that are visible in Eden but not in Zeus)
    </h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Is it compatible with AI mods?</h1>
    <h2>Technically yes, but I would advise not running any AI mods that change behavioural stuff such as ASR AI and VCOM as the mod will have (in the future) its own major AI behaviour changes.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Can I still run Ares and Zeus?</h1>
    <h2>Yes. Additionally Mars has a Zeus login option in the client menu.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Can multiple people be in the Mars editor at the same time?</h1>
    <h2>Yes. Technically you can have an unlimited amount of people in the editor concurrently, however keep in mind that the more people there are spawning things, the more problems you're likely to encounter. I'd recommend no more than 3 users concurrently.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Can players change their view distance and terrain detail?</h1>
    <h2>Yes. Bind the client menu key in CBA controls and use that to do it.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Are there settings for who can access the editor?</h1>
    <h2>Yes. These settings are set on the server via the userconfig. You can whitelist/blacklist by Steam ID and enable first-time login.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Is there headless client support?</h1>
    <h2>Yes. Mars supports an infinite number of headless clients.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Does it work on community made maps?</h1>
    <h2>Yes. It works on every and any map.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Does it show content from all addons, or just vanilla?</h1>
    <h2>All addons. Anything that is in the game's config on game start will be serialized and used in the asset browser.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Is TFAR/ACRE supported?</h1>
    <h2>Only ACRE for now. There is an optional ACRE addon in the optionals folder.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>Download doesn't contain any PBO's?</h1>
    <h2>Download the mod from the <a href="https://github.com/marseditor/mars/releases">releases</a> page.</h2>
</div>

<div class="qa">
    <h1>How do I open the Mars editor?</h1>
    <h2>In Configure > Controls > Configure Addons > Mars bind the client menu and editor keys. You can use either to login to the editor.</h2>
</div>
